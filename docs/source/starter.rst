Getting Started
===============

Installation 

Install the formpy library with pip or your favourite package manager:

.. code-block:: python
    
    pip install formpy

Create a template in docs, word, excel or whatever your comfortable using, it needs to be converted into an image before formpy can use it.
(you can also download a template from the `formpy website <https://formpy.ismailmo.com/starter-doc/>`_)
